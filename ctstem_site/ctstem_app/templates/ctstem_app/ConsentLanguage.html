  <div class="header">Key Information about this research study: </div>
  <div>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether you want to be a part of this study. The purpose of this study is to improve computational thinking lessons and teacher training for science and math teachers. Computational thinking (CT) is the thinking process a person would use when they are trying to solve a math or science problem while using a computer. We have developed CT lessons for high school biology, chemistry, physics, and math classes. The goal of our lessons is to help teachers prepare students for careers in science and math. We expect that you will be in this research study for about two weeks. But, your participation in this study will last as long as your teacher and school use this web site and curriculum. The primary risk of participation is similar to that of being a student in school and using an online portal. There is a risk that your anonymized responses could somehow be identified based on your answers. You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. We expect about 500 children will be in this research study. You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</div>

  <div class="header">Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</div>
  <div>I am asking you to take part in this research study because you are a student and your teacher is using this website as part of his/her curriculum. </div>

  <div class="header"> What should I know about a research study?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
      <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
      <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="header">If you say that “Yes, you want to be in this research,” here is what you will do</div>
  <div>If you agree to participate, your answers to questions in the online lessons will be shared with the research team. Your answers will be anonymized. </div>

  <div class="header">What happens if I do not want to be in this research or if I say “Yes”, but I change my mind later? </div>
  <div>You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, click on the “Edit Profile” link in the menu bar and select “I do not agree” option for this consent form.   Any data already collected will not be saved. You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. </div>


  <div class="header">What happens to the information collected for the research?</div>
  <div>Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. If you agree to be part of this research study, we will look at your anonymous responses to the curriculum and assessments hosted on this web site. Your responses will be stored on a secure web server maintained by Northwestern University’s School of Education and Social Policy.</div>

  <div class="header">Who can I talk to?</div>
